  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>My name is Troy Gromley and I am a student at NEIT in the Web Development and software program. I am currently learning HTML and python. Outside of school my hobbies include the gym and reading. My past work experience includes being a landscaper for my fathers company and my own LLC where I did a bunch of landscaping jobs on the properties in my town and even rennovations on houses and cottages. </body>
